This folder is just a basic read me since we all have a basic understanding of git

1. when performing or collaborating via gitgub you first need to clone the repositoty by doing a git clone repository name. e.g for this project on your terminal you do a git clone (git clone <github repo>)

2. create a new branch for the project. name e.g ezinnes-branch an navigate to the branch you can use this command git checkout <branchname>
