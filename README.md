This folder is just a basic read me since we all have a basic understanding of git

1. when performing or collaborating via gitgub you first need to clone the repositoty by doing a git clone repository name. e.g for this project on your terminal you do a git clone (git clone <github repo>).

2. create a new branch for the project. name e.g ezinnes-branch and navigate to the branch you can use this command git branch <branchname> then git checkout <branchname>(this will create a branch and put you in that branch)
   *use git branch to show the branch you are currently working on
   *git branch -a to show all the branches

- You can also create your branch on the git hub page.

3. Do a git pull. once you have navigated to your branch do a git pull of the whole repository to ensure so he could see the branch in the local development environment.

4. Solve the issue and perform a commit via git commit -m "<give it a reasonable message to what you are working on>"

5. Perform a git push.

6. Create a pull request and compare the code with the master branch (i will take it up from here).
